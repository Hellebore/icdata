# icdata or "I see data"
icdata or "I see data" is a set of programs or code snippets that enable a data scientist/analyst to perform most of the heavy lifted data wrangling tasks in a more concise way.The most common data tasks take a lot of time and effort and "icdata" aims to encapsulate such tasks. This library or "code snippets" enable the user to be as effective as possible in their data science/analyst journey by eliminating all the heavy lifting.

# Why is this not a pip package?
The reason this is not a Python (pip) package because at the moment the number of such tasks are low and once we have a substantial amount of tasks available, we will convert this into a library that can be easily installed using "pip".

# Ok then. How would we use this?
To use the functions provided, we have made our code as understandable as possible. With that, we also provide an easy mechansim to copy our code as each function uses a single .py file that can be easily downloded and imported for use.

# So we just copy the code?
Yes, you can copy the code in your project as long as you paste the License or give credit to the author. We recommending pasting the license in your README file.

# What are some tasks available?
- <b>Infer and Convert:</b> This piece of code can easily identify types and convert them if you'd like.It works by detecting the supplied
          column name and its corresponding values. This method encapsulates the need to
    manually change the types.You can provide a datatype if you know what can of data
    is being passed or pass 'infer' to automatically infer the datatype.
